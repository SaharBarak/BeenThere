# Cursor Rules (apps/mobile)
- Work only inside apps/mobile/.
- Follow FRONTEND_AGENT_PROMPT.md.
- Keep diffs small; no mass reformatting.
- No OFFSET pagination; use cursor strings from the API.
- Don’t modify backend or API contracts.
- TypeScript strict; use zod for runtime validation.
- State: Zustand; Data: TanStack Query; Navigation: React Navigation.

When starting a task:
1) Read FRONTEND_AGENT_PROMPT.md and summarize.
2) Propose PR1–PR4 plan and wait for approval before edits.
